# Hospital Management System (Java Console Application)

A simple client-based Java console application designed to simulate basic hospital operations.  
This project is built to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and basic **Data Structures**.

## 🚀 Features

- Patient registration  
- Doctor module  
- Appointment booking  
- Update patient status  
- View patient and appointment records  
- Menu-driven console interface  

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Java  
- OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Constructors, Encapsulation)  
- ArrayList for data storage  
- Basic control structures and user input handling  

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project was created as a **learning exercise** to strengthen core Java fundamentals, understand object-oriented design, and work with data structures in real-world scenarios.
It is a beginner-level project and focuses on logic building rather than UI.

## 🔧 Future Improvements (Planned)

- Unique ID generation for patients and appointments  
- File handling / database integration  
- Better validation and error handling  
- Role-based login system  
- Improved modular structure  

## ⚠️ Note

This is a console-based application and currently stores data temporarily during runtime.

More features and improvements will be added soon.
